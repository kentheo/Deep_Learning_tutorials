You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above. You can use either `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential` API. \n",

    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",

    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
